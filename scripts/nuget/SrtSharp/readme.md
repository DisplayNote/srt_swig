# SrtSharp

## Overview
SrtSharp is a .NET wrapper for the official [Haivision SRT](https://github.com/Haivision/srt) developed by [Cinegy](https://www.cinegy.com/). This package utilizes [SWIG](https://www.swig.org/) for interfacing with the SRT library, along with custom adaptations to fit .NET standards. 

## Features
- **.NET Standard 2.0 Library**: Ensures compatibility with a wide range of .NET applications.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports both x64 Linux and Windows runtimes.
- **Efficient SRT Handling**: Leverages Haivision's SRT for low-latency video streaming.

## Installation
You can install SrtSharp via NuGet Package Manager or the dotnet CLI:

```shell
dotnet add package SrtSharp
```
